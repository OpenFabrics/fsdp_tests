## Purpose

The env_setup task is to be run after /distribution/check-install but
before any /kernel/infiniband/* test case.

The goal of env_setup is to prepare hosts with environment variables that
supplies all information needed for /kernel/infiniband/* test cases and
ensures that the RDMA network is up and sane.

The env_setup task requires that user specifies two
parameters:
  RDMA_DRIVER - the IB driver to test over
                examples: mlx5, cxgb4, hfi1
  RDMA_NETWORK - the network to perform test communications over
                 examples: ib0, roce, iw, opa0

Note: a job XML/XSL is provided in this directory.  However, this
      task should *rarely* be submitted on its own.  Instead,
      continue to submit IB test cases by submitting them from their
      own directory, as they will all include the env_setup task
      and the RDMA_NETWORK / RDMA_DRIVER flags.


## Where/How to run

Continue to run all other IB tests as normal, now with the ability
to add the following flags to bkr workflow-xslt commands:
   -i <driver> -e <network>

If running this case manually, you should:
  * Change directory to /mnt/tests/kernel/infiniband/env_setup:
      $ cd /mnt/tests/kernel/infiniband/env_setup
  * Either define CLIENTS and SERVERS in your .bashrc or from the command line, eg:
      $ export SERVERS="node-01"
      $ export CLIENTS="node-02"
  * From the command line, run one of the following:
    1. $ ENV_NETWORK=<network> ENV_DRIVER=<driver> make run
       i.e. something like: $ ENV_NETWORK="iw" ENV_DRIVER="cxgb4" make run
Again, the ENV_NETWORK and ENV_DRIVER parameters are required.

Executing this env_setup alone can be done either with the singlehost
or multihost XML/XSL files provided in this directory.  If adding
env_setup to any of your test cases, you can either specify it with
CLIENTS/SERVERS roles or just a STANDALONE role.
